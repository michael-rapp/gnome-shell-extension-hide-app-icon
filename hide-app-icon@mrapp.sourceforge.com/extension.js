 *  Gnome Shell Extension - Hide App Icon - README
 * ================================================
 * 
 * The GNOME Shell Extension "Hide App Icon" allows to hide the icon of the
 * currently focused application in the top panel of the GNOME shell.
 * 
 * This extension is available on Sourceforge via the following URL:
 * 
 * https://sourceforge.net/p/hide-app-icon
 * 
 * ==============
 *  Installation
 * ==============
 * 
 * For using this extension it is necessary to copy the folder
 * "hide-app-icon@mrapp.sourceforge.com", which is contained by the package,
 * the extension has been shiped with, to the path
 * "~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions". For installing the extension this
 * way, the shell script INSTALL.sh can be used. This script automatically
 * copies all relevant files to the appropriate folder and replaces an already
 * installed version of the extension, if existing. When using the bash script,
 * the installation of this extension is possible by running the following
 * commands in a terminal (the name of the zip-file maybe has to be adjusted 
 * to the actual version of the release):
 *  
 * $ unzip gnome-shell-extension-title-to-panel-v.1.0.zip 
 * $ cd gnome-shell-extension-title-to-panel
 * $./INSTALL.sh
 * 
 * To enable the extension an application such like "Gnome Tweak Tool" may be 
 * used.
